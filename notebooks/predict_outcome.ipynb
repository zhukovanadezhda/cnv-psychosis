    "# Prediction of the outcome (converters vs non-converters) based on CNV parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Two predictive models were developed to distinguish between converters (n=302) and non-converters (n=75) based on a set of CNV parameters. The models chosen for this analysis were logistic regression and random forest. Logistic regression was selected due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for identifying key predictors that distinguish between the two groups. Random forest was chosen because of its ability to capture complex interactions between features, and its robustness against overfitting, which makes it suitable for exploring more complex relationships within the data.\n"

    "Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset (with a significantly higher number of converters compared to non-converters), specific strategies were employed to ensure robust model performance and avoid bias towards the majority class. Cross-validation with class weights was utilized to address this imbalance. In the logistic regression model, class weights were adjusted to provide greater emphasis on the minority class (non-converters) during model training, thereby ensuring that the predictive models accurately identified instances of both converters and non-converters. For the random forest model, the class weights were similarly adjusted to enhance sensitivity towards the minority class.  \n",

This approach provided a more reliable evaluation of the model's predictive power across different subsets of data."
